Complete GitOps -----
Gitops uses git as a single source of truth to deliver application and infrastructure.

when we make a change in our git repository so we send a pull request then there is a request verification machanism. theny our changes are get deployed in git repository.
thereafter, we use CI platform like Jenkins for building our application. means there is a proper machanism for CI part.Means if we have a proper git integrated approch for CI so why not for CD. then GitOps cpmes in picture.
Same there is a machanism for CD Part which we calls GitOps.

Example - We are updating our node configuration in kubernetes cluster like we are modifying our menifest.yaml file. so will put our declerative yaml menifest into the git repository. Now there is a user who send a pull request and then it is reviewed by other devops engineer in our team. and once he approved then the yaml change merged into the repository. then there is a gitops tool, that pics this change and deployed it in your kubernetes cluster.
What problem gitops solves - it solves the problem where we don't have a track of our deployment.
This can be the pull machanism like gitops and also push like we can use webhook for pushing it to gitops.

Advantage - GitOps continously reconciling our changes -  means you can not changes from directly kubernetes cluster you have to change it inside Git repo then it will make in the cluster.
Gitops controller monitor all our kubernetes resources and keep a cache of it and same for git side, it monitor the state and keep a cache of this also. then its compare the two states if there is any difference it overide it.
